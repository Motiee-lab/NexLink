## 🚀 About NexLink

NexLink is not just another social clone; it is a fully functional, reactive social ecosystem. Built with a "Future-First" design philosophy, it utilizes a stunning Glassmorphism aesthetic and integrates **Nexus AI**—an intelligent agent with administrative capabilities embedded directly into the platform's core.

## ✨ Features

### 🎨 **Modern Experience**
*   **Glassmorphism UI:** A stunning, translucent interface with animated backgrounds and blur effects.
*   **Responsive Design:** Fully fluid layout that works perfectly on mobile and desktop.
*   **Smooth Animations:** Native-feeling transitions and micro-interactions.

### 📱 **Social Core**
*   **Rich Feed:** Post text, images, and videos with support for mentions (`@user`) and mentions of `@everyone`.
*   **Interactive Stories:** Create 24-hour stories with drag-and-drop text overlays, color customization, and stickers.
*   **Reactions:** Like, Comment, and Share functionality with real-time state updates.

### 💬 **Communication**
*   **Real-Time Messenger:** Instant messaging for 1-on-1 private chats and group conversations.
*   **Group Management:** Admin controls, adding/removing members, and archiving chats.
*   **Media Sharing:** Send images and reply to stories directly within chat.

### 🤖 **Nexus AI (God Mode)**
*   **Administrative Power:** The AI can manage users, ban accounts, reset passwords, and create content via natural language commands.
*   **Auto-Reply:** The AI can autonomously reply to comments and chat messages.
*   **Content Generation:** Capable of generating posts and facilitating conversation.
*   **Multi-Key Support:** Supports comma-separated API keys for load balancing to prevent rate limits.

## 🛠 Technology

This project is built using a cutting-edge stack focused on performance and developer experience.

| Tech | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **React 19** | The latest version of the library for web and native user interfaces. |
| **TypeScript** | Strongly typed JavaScript for robust code quality. |
| **Tailwind CSS** | Utility-first CSS framework for rapid, beautiful UI development. |
| **Zustand** | Small, fast, and scalable bearbones state-management solution. |

## ⚡ Getting Started

To run NexLink locally or on Replit:

### Prerequisites
*   Node.js (v18+)
*   Google Gemini API Key(s)

### Installation

1.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment**
    Create a secret or environment variable named `API_KEY` (or `VITE_API_KEY`) with your Google Gemini API key.
    
    > **Tip:** To avoid rate limits, you can provide multiple API keys separated by commas (e.g., `key1,key2,key3`). The app will automatically rotate through them.

3.  **Run the App**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## 🎮 Nexus AI Capabilities

*   *"Create a new user named John Doe with email john@example.com"*
*   *"Ban the user @Spammer"*
*   *"Write a post for me about the weather"*
*   *"I forgot my password for [email]"*
